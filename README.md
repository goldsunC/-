[中文目录](./README_zh.md)

This repository will be continuously updated to record my algorithm 
learning process.

The sources of Problems currently include:
- leetcode:[https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
- TsinghuaOJ:[https://dsa.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/oj/](https://dsa.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/oj/)

The name of each folder corresponds to the 
problem number, where **easy, mid, hard** corresponds 
to the difficulty of the problem.

The repository will be provisionally supplemented 
later, including:
- Analysis of ideas for each question
- C++ code implementation
- Study notes for each algorithm category
- and so on

At present, I am an algorithm white, 
maybe only have some simple data structure foundation, 
my goal is to improve my algorithm level through algorithm 
learning and continuous completion of algorithm problems.

At present, I have chosen a course about algorithm in school,
and the reference book is **Algorithm Design**, the author is
$Jon Kleingberg / Eva Tardos$.
