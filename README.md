This repository will be continuously updated to record my algorithm 
learning process.[中文目录](./README_zh.md)

At present, I am an algorithm white, 
maybe only have some simple data structure foundation, 
my goal is to improve my algorithm level through algorithm 
learning and continuous completion of algorithm problems.

At present, I have chosen a course about algorithm in school,
and the reference book is 'Algorithm Design', the author is
$Jon Kleingberg / Eva Tardos$.
